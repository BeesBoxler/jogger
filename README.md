An nCurses based application for logging time to Jira tickets. Because time logging has far too much friction
and I get in far too much trouble for not doing it.
![Jogger](https://github.com/beesboxler/jogger/blob/images/jogger.png?raw=true)

## Installation 
_This package relies on ncurses and therefore probably only works on Windows under WSL._

Ubuntu/Debian: 
```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
cargo install jogger
```

## First Time Setup
The first time you use this app you will be requred to set four parameters.
- Your Name (Optional)
- Your personal distraction ticket
  - Not every organisation uses this, ignore it if it doesn't apply to you
- Your Personal Access Token from Jira
  - This can be found in Profile > Personal Access Token
- Jira URL
  - This is the base URL you use when visiting JIRA
  - _ie._ `https://jira.company.com/`

Once saved, these parameters will be stored for future usage.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Being able to customise the Category and Actions presented on the logging screen
- [ ] Being able to set a custom date 
- [ ] Remove Category and Action from the logging screen
- [ ] Make it look less like ****
- [ ] Distributed binaries
